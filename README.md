[Install from Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/keepasswin/9wzdncrd91jm). It currently won't show up in searches, but it should soon.

This is a UWP implementation of [KeePass](http://keepass.info). This app currently supports the following:

- Load a file from any file picker source (including key files)
- Add entries
- Open webpage
- Copy username/password to clipboard
- Works on mobile and desktop

Things that are currently missing:

- Create a new database
- Create new groups
- Password generator
- On mobile, the file picker does not seem to work correctly with OneDrive (DropBox works to save, but must be readded every time)
- probably more, but those are the big ones

This is a side project I have worked on off and on and figured others would appreciate it and maybe help contribute. Any help is very much appreciated. Please create an issue and submit PRs if interested.
